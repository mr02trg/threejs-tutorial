Clock 
    - keep track of time https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/Clock
    - getElapsedTime () 
    - getDelta ()

Add an object B to another object A
    - Create a hierachy
    - Object B is now a child of object A
    - Object B motion is now relative to Object A instead of the Scene object (root)

Change object rotation point
    - By default, mesh rotate around (0, 0 , 0) in their geometry
    - Need to move the vertices to adjust the rotation point

Geometry base class
    - geometry.vertices to get a list of vertices of the geometry
